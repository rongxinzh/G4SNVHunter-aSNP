### A Case Study on the Usage of the G4SNVHunter Package

***

This repository contains example usage code used in our G4SNVHunter 
manuscript (being submitted) to showcase the functionality 
of the [G4SNVHunter package](https://github.com/rongxinzh/G4SNVHunter), 
which includes analysis code for the archaic SNPs identified by 
[Browning  et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.031).
